# Instructions:
# Complete each function below by writing the code for it. main() is already
# set up to test all the functions with a few different inputs, printing 'OK'
# for each function once it returns the correct result.
# The starter code for each function includes a bare 'return' which is just a
# placeholder for your code.

# D. remove_adjacent
# Given a list of numbers, return a list where all adjacent
# equal elements have been reduced to a single element.
# Example:
#   [1, 2, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 3]
# You may create a new list or modify the passed in list.
# Hint: Don't use set()


def remove_adjacent(nums):
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        if len(result) == 0 or num != result[-1]:
            result.append(num)
    return result


# E. linear_merge
# Given two lists sorted in increasing order, create and
# return a merged list of all the elements in sorted order.
# You may modify the passed in lists.
# The solution should work in "linear" time, making a single
# pass of both lists.
# Hint: Don't use `sort` or `sorted` -- they are not O(n)
# linear time and the two lists are already provided in
# ascending sorted order.

def linear_merge(list1, list2):
    result = []
    # Look at the two lists so long as both are non-empty.
    # Take whichever element [0] is smaller.
    while len(list1) and len(list2):
        if list1[0] < list2[0]:
            result.append(list1.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(list2.pop(0))

    # Now tack on what's left
    result.extend(list1)
    result.extend(list2)
    return result

# Note: the solution above is kind of cute, but unforunately list.pop(0)
# is not constant time with the standard python list implementation, so
# the above is not strictly linear time.
# An alternate approach uses pop(-1) to remove the endmost elements
# from each list, building a solution list which is backwards.
# Then use reversed() to put the result back in the correct order. That
# solution works in linear time, but is more ugly.


# Provided simple test() function used in main() to print
# what each function returns vs. what it's supposed to return.
def test(got, expected):
    if got == expected:
        prefix = ' OK '
    else:
        prefix = '  X '
    print('{} got: {} expected: {}'.format(prefix, repr(got), repr(expected)))


# The main() function calls the above functions with interesting
# inputs, using test() to check whether each result is correct or not.
def main():
    # Each line calls one of the functions above and compares its
    # result to the expected return value for that call.
